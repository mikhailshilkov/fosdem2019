# Slides and code for "Infrastructure as Typescript" session at FOSDEM 2019

Modern cloud applications consist of many moving parts, so they are hard to manage without employing Infrastructure-as-Code approach.

Traditionally, tools like CloudFormation, ARM templates and Terraform employ text-based templates, which tend to be verbose and hard to create and reuse.

What if instead of configuration files you could just use Typescript? Meet Pulumi—an open-source library which brings types, components, conditionals, and much more to your cloud infrastructure definition.
